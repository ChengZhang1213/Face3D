/**
 * @brief Representation of an image with \p num_channels channels.
 *
 * This is a quickly hacked-together implementation of an image class, to be able
 * to represent 1 and 3-channel images. The class was mainly created to be able to
 * remove OpenCV and cv::Mat as a dependency for the core of the eos headers.
 *
 * The class currently uses col-major storage order.
 *
 * Note: Ideally we'd have a template param for row and col major too?
 *       And then we could do stuff like strides and all too but then we'd end up with a matrix class like Eigen::Matrix...?
 *       It means we probably can't accept ROI's from Python into larger images without copying, but doesn't matter.
 *       Also what about vector<Eigen::Matrix>(num_channels)? But having an own type would be good?
